        <p class="program-font"> Kingdom Youths is a Non-Profit Organization that provides educational services and mentoring for youths as well as young adults who may have missed the opportunity earlier in life. The program will afford them opportunity to receive the education and basic skills they missed. Those who may want to go to college can do so while those who may desire a better paid job can as well profit thereby. Kingdom Youths program will benefit youths who “feel rejected”. It will help them to bounce back and feel confident and proud of themselves that they can be useful to themselves and the community in which they. It will foster a great commitment to the youths and Young adults in the Neighborhood. They will be academically, emotionally, socially, physically challenged to follow through the path of success in the society and restore their confidence and self- image.</p>
        <div class="spacing"></div>
        <p class="program-font"> These individuals can be reached through the City Council, Schools, Churches and parents. Many youths and young adults walk the streets in different neighborhoods with no visible means of livelihood because of lack of basic education and job skills. Lack of good GPA denies most of them admission into college thereby frustrating them. Many of them feel hopeless and some resort to crime which would never have been an option for them. Something must be done to help them and also help the community and that is why Kingdom Youths has been founded to help. </p>
        <div class="spacing"></div>
        <p class="program-font">
          Kingdom Youths will focus primarily on youths that dropped out of school. The projection is that within three years, 50% of the youths in the program would have taken and passed the GED Test and be ready for college or get better paying jobs. Kingdom Youths being also a mentoring program will work hard to pair the youths with adults that have succeeded in life, both academically and professionally. These adults will serve as mentors to them by working with them. The youths will begin to see life from a more proactive perspective. This will help to change their perspective in life and keep them focused on success. As time goes on, Kingdom Youths will create an environment for learning that will provide a huge academic resource Center for youths and Young Adults who have the desire to progress in life and help the society. To reach these groups of young people, our organization will have to work with the school sand the churches of which we are one. We shall work with the council offices, as well as the Neighborhoods. We shall do a lot of marketing of the program and help the intending clients understand the importance of the program. Our organization will also advertise the program on Face-book, local Newspapers, Flyers, and Penny-Savers etc. We shall build a very attractive Informative Website that will attract people to the program.
